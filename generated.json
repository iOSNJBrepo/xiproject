Chimera doesn't tamper with user files, making it safer than alternatives.\n\nStable\n\nWe've rewritten Chimera from the ground up to ensure that there's no battery drain, freezing, or crashing. There's simply nothing else like it, and we can't wait for you to see for yourself.\n\nModern\n\nChimera comes with a modern package manager, Sileo, featuring a UI made to fit iOS, and packed full of features and speed enhancements to make installing packages a breeze.
